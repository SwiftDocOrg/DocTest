# DocTest

![CI][ci badge]

**DocTest** is an experimental tool
for testing Swift example code in documentation.

**This is still a work-in-progress, and not yet ready for production**

> DocTest is inspired by
> [Python's `doctest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

The hardest part of software documentation is writing it in the first place.
But once you clear that initial hurdle,
the challenge becomes keeping documentation correct and up-to-date.

There's no built-in feedback mechanism for documentation like there is for code.
If you write invalid code,
the compiler will tell you.
If you write valid but incorrect code,
your test suite will tell you.
But if you write documentation with invalid or incorrect example code,
you may never find out.

DocTest offers a way to annotate Swift code examples in documentation
with expectations about its behavior,
and test that behavior automatically —
just like a unit test.

## Requirements

- Swift 5.3

> **Note**:
> When running `swift-doctest` from a Docker container,
> pass the following options:
>
> - `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`  
>   _(allows the launched process to trace system calls from)_
> - `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`  
>   _(runs the container without the [default security profile][seccomp])_
> - `--security-opt apparmor=unconfined`  
>   _(runs the container without the [AppArmor security profile][apparmor])_
> 
> Without these permissions,
> DocTest cannot launch the Swift REPL to evaluate code statements.

## Installation

### Homebrew

Run the following command to install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```terminal
$ brew install swiftdocorg/formulae/swift-doctest
```

### Manually

Run the following commands to build and install manually:

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/DocTest
$ cd DocTest
$ make install
```

## Usage

```
OVERVIEW: A utility for syntax testing documentation in Swift code.

USAGE: swift-doctest <input> [--swift-launch-path <swift-launch-path>] [--package] [--assumed-filename <assumed-filename>]

ARGUMENTS:
  <input>                 Swift code or a path to a Swift file

OPTIONS:
  --swift-launch-path <swift-launch-path>
                          The path to the swift executable. (default:
                          /usr/bin/swift)
  -p, --package           Whether to run the REPL through Swift Package Manager
                          (`swift run --repl`).
  --assumed-filename <assumed-filename>
                          The assumed filename to use for reporting when
                          parsing from standard input. (default: Untitled.swift)
  -h, --help              Show help information.

```

## How It Works

DocTest launches and interacts with
the Swift <abbr title="Read-Eval-Print-Loop">REPL</abbr>,
passing each code statement through standard input
and reading its result through standard output and/or standard error.

Consider the following function declaration
within a Swift package:

~~~swift
/**
    Returns the sum of two integers.

    ```swift
    add(1 1) // Returns 3.0
    ```
*/
func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int { ... }
~~~

There are three problems with the example code
provided in the documentation for `add(_:_:)`:

1. It doesn't compile
   (missing comma separator between arguments)
2. It suggests an incorrect result
   (one plus one equals two, not three)
3. It suggests an incorrect type of result
   (the sum of two integers is an integer,
   which isn't expressible by a floating-point literal)

We can use DocTest to identify these problems automatically
by adding `"doctest"` to the start of the fenced code block.
This tells the documentation test runner to evaluate the code sample.

```diff
- ```swift
+ ```swift doctest
```

By adding an annotation in the format
`=> <#Value#>`,
we can test the expected type and value
of the expression.

```diff
- add(1 1) // 3.0
+ add(1 1) // => 3.0
```

Run the `swift-doctest` command
from the root directory of the Swift package
and passing the path to the file containing the `add(_:_:)` function.
This will scan for all of code blocks annotated with
<code>```swift doctest</code>,
run them through the Swift REPL,
and test the output with any annotated expectations.

```terminal
$ swift doctest --package path/to/file.swift
TAP version 13
1..1
not ok 1 - `add(1 1)` did not produce `3.0`
  ---
  column: 1
  file: path/to/file.swift.md
  line: 1
  ...
  
```

> Test results are reported in [TAP format](https://testanything.org).

Seeing the error,
we update the documentation to fix the example.

~~~swift
/**
    Returns the sum of two integers.

    ```swift doctest
    add(1, 1) // => 2
    ```
*/
func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int { ... }
~~~

If we re-run the same command as before,
the tests now pass as expected.

```terminal
$ swift doctest --package path/to/file.swift
TAP version 13
1..1
ok 1 - `add(1, 1)` produces `2`
  ---
  column: 1
  file: path/to/file.swift.md
  line: 1
  ...
  
```

> By the way, you can run `swift-doctest` on Markdown files, too —
> any code blocks starting with
> <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;swift doctest</code>
> and ending with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>
> will be processed.
